## ALL DONE?

Not quite! Now it's time to test all the components together! Btw, **CONGRATS** making this far!

Now it's time to pull all the things together and test our solution end-to-end. Before running the solution, we need to test that the connection from your IBM Cloud Functions to BAW virtual environment is working and you your Virtual Assistant configurations are correct.

## Test your IBM Cloud Functions connection to BAW

**1.** Open your IBM Cloud Functions view from your IBM Cloud account. Navigate to **_actions_**, open **Get Workflow Token** and in the code view, click the **Invoke** button from the right upper corner.

**2.** If everything is working as expected, you should see a successfull activation. **Note!** When you run your action for the first time, it might take serveral seconds (even over 10 secs) to complete. So, be patient.
