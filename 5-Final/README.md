## ALL DONE?

Not quite! Now it's time to test all the components together! Btw, **CONGRATS** making this far!

Ask your instructor to help with this. There are just a couple steps to make all of the components you have developed work together, but it is better that you do this with your instructor so that he can check that everything is in place before trying to run the test! Good luck!
